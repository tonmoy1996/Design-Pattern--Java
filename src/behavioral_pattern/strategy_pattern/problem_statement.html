  <p>
    I want to design a social media application which allows me to connect to my friends on all four social platforms i.e. Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter and Orkut (for example sake). Now I want that client should be able to tell the name of friend and desired platform â€“ then my application should connect to him transparently.

    More importantly, if I want to add more social platforms into application then application code should accommodate it without breaking the design.
